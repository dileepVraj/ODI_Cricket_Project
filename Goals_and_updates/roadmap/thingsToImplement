🚀 Phase 1 is officially COMPLETE.
You have transitioned from a "Script" to an "Enterprise Application Architecture."

What would you like to do next?

Option A: Integrate Gemini AI (Phase 2). We create ai/gemini_wrapper.py so the dashboard can not only show tables but also talk to you about the match risks.

Option B: Run the Dashboard. We fire up interface.py to see if the GUI still works perfectly with the new brain (it should!).

Option C: Build a README. Document exactly how your new folder structure works so you don't forget in 6 months.
