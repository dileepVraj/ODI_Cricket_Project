we need to implement average score and wickets per overs, ground wise, opponent wise.
Ex: for ODI avg runs and wkts in 10 overs middle overs and death overs, same for T20's.

Player vs Player:

x player average runs aganist team, total innings & dismissals aganist team.

batsmen vs specific type of bowler( we need to classify all bowlers into types).
batsmen vs bowlers matchup.
batsmen / bowler stats at current venue.
